## Codebook for Covid-19 Policy Stringency Index for Germany
This codebook is constructed on the basis of the Fedral policies for contact restrictions that we have collected to calculate the Stringecy Index. The dataset that we have collected consists of 9 indicators that have been divided into 3 main groups:
- [E: Containment policies for schools](#containment-policies-for-schools)
- [S: Containment policies for entertainment and shopping (public activities)](#containment-policies-for-public-activities)
- [R: Containment policies for private gatherings](#containment-policies-for-private-gatherings)
<p align="justify">
All the 9 indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale according to the level of policy stringency. A value of 0 always indicates no contact restriction; values of 1 or larger represent an increase in the policy’s level of contact stringency. The data set further assigns each policy entry three additional values, namely two binary variables, the flag and the recorded flag, as well as the maximum value of the policy’s affiliated indicator. While the flag variable distinguishes between indicators that are not characterized by their geographic scope (0) and those that are (1), the recorded flag indicates whether an indicator was implemented at the state (0) or national (1) level.

### Calculating Indicies

First we calculate the *Sub Score Index for each of the 9 indicators*. Then we calculate Sub Score Index for the broader categories and the aggregate Stringency Index.

| Indicator | Max. value | Flag |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| E1 | 2(0,1,2) | yes=1 |
| E2 | 3(0,1,2,3) | yes=1 |
| E3 | 3(0,1,2,3) | yes=1 |
| E4 | 3(0,1,2,3) | yes=1 |
| S1 | 3(0,1,2,3) | yes=1 |
| S2 | 2(0,1,2) | yes=1 |
| S3 | 2(0,1,2) | yes=1 |
| S4 | 2(0,1,2) | yes=1 |
| R1 | 8(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) | yes=1 |

The Sub Score Index(_I_) for each indicator (_j_) and for each day (_t_), is calculated by the following formula: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Eq1}
  I_{j,t} = 100\frac{v_{j,t} - 0.5\left(F_j - f_{j,t}\right)}{N_j}
\end{equation}

where,
- _N<sub>j</sub>_ is the maximum value of the indicator
- _F<sub>j</sub>_ is the flag value of the indicator
- _v<sub>j,t</sub>_ is the policy value on the ordinal scale
- _f<sub>j,t</sub>_ is the recorded flag value of the indicator

A simple average of indicators under each of the catergories would give *Sub Score Index for the respective category* and an average of all the indicators would give the **Stringency Index**. 

| Index name | _k_ | E1 | E2 | E3 | E4 | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | R1 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `E_Index_Score` | 4 | `x` | `x` | `x` | `x` | |  |  |  |  |
| `S_Index_Score` | 4 |  |  |  |  | `x` | `x` | `x` | `x` | |
| `R_Index_Score` | 1 |  |  | |  |  |  |  |  | `x` | 
| `stringency_index_score`| 9 | `x` | `x` | `x` | `x` | `x` | `x` | `x`| `x`|  `x` |
