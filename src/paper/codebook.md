## Codebook for Covid-19 Policy Stringency Index for Germany

This codebook is constructed on the basis of the Fedral policies for contact restrictions that we have collected to calculate the Stringecy Index. The dataset that we have collected consists of 9 indicators that have been divided into 3 main groups:
- E: Containment policies for schools
- S: Containment policies for entertainment and shopping (public activities)
- R: Containment policies for private gatherings
All the 9 indicators are recorded on an ordinal scale according to the level of policy stringency. A value of zero always indicates no contact restriction; values of 1 or larger represent an increase in the policy’s level of contact stringency. The data set further assigns each policy entry three additional values, namely two binary variables, the flag and the recorded flag, as well as the maximum value of the policy’s affiliated indicator. While the flag variable distinguishes between indicators that are not characterized by their geographic scope (0) and those that are (1), the recorded flag indicates whether an indicator was implemented at the state (0) or national (1) level.
